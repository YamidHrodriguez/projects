            <h2>Biography</h2><br>
            <p>Vincent van Gogh was a Dutch painter and one of the most prominent figures of post-impressionism. He was born on March 30, 1853, in Zundert, Netherlands, and died on July 29, 1890, in Auvers-sur-Oise, France¹. Van Gogh painted around 800 paintings, including 43 self-portraits and 148 watercolors, and created over 1600 drawings¹. His first major work was "The Potato Eaters," painted in 1885¹. <br><br> He is known for his use of bold colors and expressive brushwork, which influenced many artists in the 20th century, including the German expressionists and the Fauvists¹². Van Gogh's life was marked by poverty, mental illness, and a lack of recognition for his work¹².His works were not famous until after his death. He died at the age of 37, from a gunshot wound, which is believed to have been self-inflicted¹².<br><br>
    
            Here is a poem I came up with in honor of Vincent van Gogh:</p>

                ```
            The Starry Night, a masterpiece,
            A painting that will never cease,
            To captivate and mesmerize,
            With swirling stars and moonlit skies. <br><br>
            
            Van Gogh's brushstrokes, bold and bright,
            A vision of the world in sight,
            A troubled soul, a tortured mind,
            A life that left so much behind.
            <br><br>
            His art lives on, a legacy,
            A testament to what could be,
            A world of beauty, love, and light,
            A world that van Gogh made just right.
            ```
